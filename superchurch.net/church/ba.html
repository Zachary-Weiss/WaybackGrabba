<h2 align="center">What is The Benign All?</h2>

<p>The Benign All is sort of a force that binds the good parts of the universe together. I
say &quot;sort of&quot; because it doesn't so much bind things as flow through them, and
then only the good things. What are the good things? Well, that depends on who you are.
For me, <a HREF="http://superchurch.net/church/revs.html#bobby">Bobby
Gelner</a>, good things include snack chips, government checks, and the knowledge that I
am Ultra-High Priest Bobby Gelner. For <a
HREF="http://superchurch.net/homepage/lord_jess.html">Rev. Jeff</a>, it
means tall girls with dark hair, a children's book called &quot;Higglety Pigglety
Pop!&quot;, and staring bare-eyed at the sun for hours at a time. For you, it could mean
almost anything. Doesn't matter a tic. </p>

<p>As Rev. Jeff has pointed out in numerous subtle philosophical papers -- most of which
recieved not-so-subtle grading and commentary -- what is good for each of us is
necessarily subjective, so the only objective good is the bond between all those
subjective goods -- just that ephemeral something on which all our subjective judgments of
good are based. That something is what we at SuperChurch<font SIZE="-2">®</font> call the
Benign All. </p>

<p>By way of many drunken experiments, we have discovered that respecting this
metaphysical epoxy tends to encourage more good things to come your way. Now that's prayer
with purpose! All you need to do is focus on the <a
href="http://superchurch.net/church/buzzwords.html">Buzzwords</a>, when you
have some free time, repeating them as you would a mantra, and things will begin looking
better. Trust us. </p>

<p>I'm not so sure what a good deal of this means, but Rev. Jeff has assured me that it's
based on sound thinking, and he <i>was</i> a philosophy major. </p>

<p>Hope this clears things up. </p>
