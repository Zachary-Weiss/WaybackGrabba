1. The user enters the url of a site contained on the web archive. For example: ```"http://www.superchurch.net/"```. I also need to get this part of the url out: ```www.superchurch.net/```. The URL should end in a / or a file extension. I need to do this so I can get out the directory structure, which will follow it. The user should also be able to add a date, which will be the latest date that a snapshot can be grabbed from. I will need to create a directory for everything after ```http://```. For this example, only one dir would be created, called ```www.superchurch.net```. I will also need to store the absolute path to this dir so I can cd to it as needed.

2. This url is passed into waybackpack with the list flag, and the output of this is passed into a txt file. The command, used with the above url, looks like this: ```waybackpack http://www.superchurch.net/ --to-date 20001010 --list```. If the user didn't give a date, the --to-date flag and its argument will be omitted.

3. The last line of the txt file, which will be the most recent snapshot before the date the user specified, is passed into dateGetter.exe, which grabs the date from the url. Don't forget to remove or clear the text file.

4. This date can be used with waybackpack to get a single snapshot of the site from that date. That command will look like this: ```waybackpack http://www.superchurch.net/ --from-date 20000914 --to-date 20000914 -d .``` This will create a directory whose name is the date of the snapshot. Inside of this dir is the directory structure leading to the page we downloaded. We need to cd until we get to the content itself and then move it to ROOTDIR/path/to/file, and then remove the directory structure that came with the file we downloaded.

5. If the page we just downloaded is a html file, then we scan it for <a></a> tags and store links. For each link, if it's contained in the same directory of a subdirectory of the original html file, then we repeat all the above steps on it. For example, if we found a link to http://www.superchurch.net/
