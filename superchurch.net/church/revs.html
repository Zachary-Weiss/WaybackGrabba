<h2 align="center">The SuperChurch<font SIZE="-3">®</font> Hierarchy</h2>

<p>While SuperChurch<font SIZE="-3">®</font> has no <i>real</i> hierarchy, there are some
who are ranked higher than others by way of seniority. So actually, the SuperChurch<font
SIZE="-3">®</font> does have a hierarchy. Anyway, here are some of those higher-ups,
along with brief bios: </p>

<font SIZE="+2"><strong>Rev. Brer Kat Meow Tse-Tongue </strong></font></p>

<p>Rev. Brer Kat, Director of Meowtaphysics and Predacious Studies, is the Abyssinian who
rules Rev. Jeff. He leads the DOFC Taskforce and produced <a
HREF="http://superchurch.net/church/stay_alive.html">this chart</a>. He's
not at all interested in hearing any of your shit.. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://superchurch.net/gifs/zoe.jpg"
alt="The VunderBebe"></a><br>
<font SIZE="+2"><strong>Zoe the WonderBaby</strong></font> </p>

<p>Zoe is now more than three years old. Under Rev. Ralph's tutelage, she has already
mastered Sanskrit and Russian, and has written a paper criticizing Newtonian physics which
was published in Duke University's <i>Subtext</i> magazine. Zoe currently holds a
fellowship at Oberlin in Ohio. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><a name="bobby"><font SIZE="+2">Ultra-High Priest Bobby Gelner
[incarcerated]</font></a></strong><br>
UHP Gelner was responsible for SuperChurch<font SIZE="-3">®</font> in the sense that he
was the first mortal <a href="http://superchurch.net/church/bg1.html">contacted</a>
by the <a href="http://superchurch.net/church/ba.html">Benign All</a>. The
UHP is presently unemployed and not receiving his paltry GI benefits due to an unfortunate
assault on Sheriff who was &quot;<i>way</i> too frisky.&quot; UHP Gelner is up for work
release soon, and he would welcome any employment opportunity. His back is strong and he
can &quot;outwork 10 of them illegals.&quot; He lives in Egypt, TX. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="jess"><img
src="http://superchurch.net/gifs/ljess.gif" alt="'Lil Jeff"></a><br>
<font SIZE="+2"><strong>Rev. Jeff</strong></font> </p>

<p><a href="http://superchurch.net/lord_jess.html">Reverend Jeff</a>,
Director of Metaphysics, is doing something vaguely related to law in the Twin Cities. He
reports being very happy to be out of Iowa, and is apparantly not yet aware of the winters
yet to come.</p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><a name="brion"><img
src="http://superchurch.net/gifs/grep.gif" alt="GREP!"></a><br>
<font SIZE="+2"><strong>Rev. GREP</strong></font> </p>

<p><a HREF="http://superchurch.net/church/grepbio.html">Reverend GREP,
Director of Information, wrote his own bio</a>. </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><a name="dave"><img
src="http://superchurch.net/gifs/davo.gif" alt="Jobless Fiance!"></a><br>
<font SIZE="+2"><strong>Rev. Davo</strong> [suspended]</font> </p>

<p>Reverend Davo, Director of Charisma, having conquered most of Europe and Northern
Africa, is presently living in pre-nuptial bliss in some incestual town in North Carolina.
He has been very tightlipped concerning future goals, but has made vague references to
both physics and stock car racing.. The High Council has placed Rev. Davo on indefinite
suspension for techno-weeniness, and general accusations of spinelessness (though we must
admit, it's awfully charismatic spinelessness). </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><a name="shaanti"><img
src="http://superchurch.net/gifs/shaanti.jpg" alt="Shaanti"></a><br>
<font SIZE="+2"><strong>Shaanti the SuperNurse</strong></font> </p>

<p>SuperNurse Shaanti is a nurse practitioner in Austin. She specializes in labor and
delivery, which is of precious little use to those of us who just want some needless
prescriptions for liquid valium.&nbsp; Rev. Shaanti is wholly against any and all of our
actions, and accepted an appointment to the High Council merely to keep us silly boys out
of trouble. </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><a name="mollie"><img
src="http://superchurch.net/gifs/mollie.jpg" alt="Mollie"></a><br>
<font SIZE="+2"><strong>Rev. Mollie</strong></font> </p>

<p>Rev. Mollie, SuperChurch Hair Czar, is a heartless advertising exec in NYC. She spends
her 26 hour days figuring how close the carrot can be dangled in front of the nose before
the sucker catches on and changes the channel. But she's got <em>fabulous</em> hair.</p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><a name="biji"><img
src="http://superchurch.net/gifs/bralph.jpg" alt="Weejers"></a><br>
<font SIZE="+2"><strong>Rev. Biji</strong></font> </p>

<p>Reverend Bijou, shown here with Rev. Ralph, is a fluffy bichon frise currently residing
in Boca Raton, FL. He spends his days consulting with Rev. Ralph and worrying that the
cats aren't being disciplined nearly enough. Rev. Biji is still quite angry at Rev. Jeff
for <a HREF="http://superchurch.net/church/history.html">kidnapping</a>
Rev. Ralph and taking him to Texas. </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><a name="ralph"><img
src="http://superchurch.net/gifs/ralph.gif" alt="Not a Bone!"></a><br>
<font SIZE="+2"><strong>Rev. Ralph</strong></font> </p>

<p>Reverend Ralph is what one might call a bone, if one were incredibly callous. He
prefers to be referred to formally, or as an Ossified American. Rev. Ralph holds over 129
Master's degrees, in subjects ranging from diction to relationships to microwaving. His
recently published paper, researched in Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, proved his thesis
that all the clams there are happy. Along with Rev. Biji, Rev. Ralph is currently not
speaking to Rev. Jeff. </p>
