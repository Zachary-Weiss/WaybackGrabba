<p align="center"><u><strong><a NAME="carmex"><font SIZE="+1">1. Use Lots of Carmex<font
SIZE="-3">®</font></font></a><br>
</strong></u>Throughout our human history and prehistory, people have found that certain
substances enable them to achieve a higher state of consciousness. It could be they were
actually hitting a lower level of consciousness, but once you leave the normal one, who
really cares? These substances have ranged from various fermented foods to oils to plants
to certain fungi, each with its own merits and drawbacks. At the <strong>SuperChurch<font
SIZE="-3">®</font></strong>, our substance of choice is Carmex<font SIZE="-3">®</font>.
Within the guise of a cheery lip balm is a truly mind-opening product. Rub a large amount
on your lips, and then smear some inside each nostril and take a deep breath through your
nose. The <strong>Benign All</strong> is around us, and it smells something like menthol. </p>

<hr>
<a NAME="snack"><strong><font SIZE="+1">

<p align="center">2. Aim for Variety in Your Snack Foods</font></strong></a><br>
As <strong>UHP Bobby Gelner</strong> says, a placid, mundane life is an empty life. But it
doesn't have to be. Not if you're willing to munch often and daringly. Don't just buy corn
chips! Try some melba toast. Have a handful of Grape-Nuts without milk. As you begin to
accept subtle dietary changes, you will become less resistant to spiritual changes. Feel
the crunch. Feel the change from within. </p>

<hr>
<a NAME="blinker"><strong><font SIZE="+1">

<p align="center">3. When Changing Lanes, Always Use Your Blinker</font></strong></a><br>
Nothing says &quot;I am an individualist; I care for nothing but my own concerns&quot;
like haphazardly switching lanes without signaling your fellow motorists of your
intentions. The SuperChurch<font SIZE="-3">®</font> supports the idea behind Karma, but
not the possibility of Karma's existence, so you should not click your blinker with the
idea of reward or avoidance of retribution. There is a reward, though. It is the knowledge
that you have made, in your own small way, a contribution to the safety and well-being of
your fellow travelers. Remember: if you change paths without anyone's knowledge, no one
will know. </p>

<hr>
<font SIZE="+1"><strong><a NAME="call">

<p align="center">4. If You Tell Someone You Will Call Them, Call Them</a></strong></font><br>
Why wouldn't you? The web of societal interaction is very fragile, and is paralleled
internally by all those trapped in it. We reach for strands blindly, and when one is not
there -- when an expected call is not made -- we fall a little, and maybe get hurt. Keep
those strands strong. Have a care for the emotional safety of others. Of course, there are
problems. A frequent parting line in American discourse is &quot;Call me.&quot; If you
agree to this, with no intentions of actually calling, you may hurt the person. What to
do? The honorable thing. Tell them, &quot;No, I won't call you. I have no interest in
speaking to you until you can do me some benefit.&quot; It may seem that this is a more
brutal action than simply not calling, but remember that things often seem other than they
are -- which is why the word exists -- and that we know more than you. </p>

<hr>
<a NAME="things"><font SIZE="+1"><strong>

<p align="center">5. Never Assume Things Will Get Better; Make Them Better</strong></font></a><br>
A common suggestion, yes, but a good one. You may have heard it in one of the many
self-improvement seminars you've attended, or seen it on the Greyhound en route to
Jamestown. What's important about it -- the real focus of the Rule -- is the word
&quot;Things&quot;. You might interpret those things to be things pertaining to you, or
your situation. This reading is only partially accurate. What things refers to is all
things, or everything. As you are a member of humanity, all things certainly affect you in
one way or the other, but, and more importantly, they affect everyone else. Never assume
that things are for the best. Love your neighbors, but don't trust them to do the same. As
things improve, they will come around to your way of being, and your way, the right way,
will necessarily improve in terms of happy satisfaction. </p>

<hr>
<a NAME="ferret"><font SIZE="+1"><strong>

<p align="center">6. Don't Buy a Ferret</strong></font></a><br>
Never, never buy a ferret. While there is no such thing as absolute or objective evil, if
there were, it would be embodied by these elongated rats. Nothing can distract you from
the <strong>Benign All</strong> more quickly than the rambunctious padding of four dirty
paws across your kitchen floor. Make no mistake, these things are bad. Avoid them. If your
neighbors have one, taunt it without mercy. </p>

<hr>
<a NAME="potato"><font SIZE="+1"><strong>

<p align="center">7. Poke Holes in Potatoes Before Baking Them</strong></font></a><br>
If you think the pains of lonely isolation are bad, try lonely isolation combined with
poorly cooked potatoes. Just as you must drive to the core of your being to find what
holds you back, you must poke to the core of a potato so that it may release its inner
poisons and be thoroughly cleansed by the oven's heat. Cook Well, Eat Well. Eat Well, Be
Well. </p>

<hr>
<a NAME="think"><font SIZE="+1"><strong>

<p align="center">8. Think as Much as You Possibly Can</strong></font></a><br>
Make time to think. Sure, you spend the whole day thinking, but thinking about things, be
they rent, groceries, proper footwear, or even the<strong> Benign All</strong>. You must
also simply think. The powers of reason must be strengthened on their own. <strong>UHP
Gelner</strong> calls this process<strong> Cognitive Isometrics</strong>. It is difficult
at first, as you will be tempted to think about thinking. Eventually, with practice, you
will see the benefits in your everyday life. And maybe you won't get that report in on
time, or the customer will have to wait a few extra minutes for his fries. You'll be
better for it, and so will everyone else. </p>

<hr>
<a name="hello"><font SIZE="+1"><strong>

<p align="center">9. Always Say &quot;Hello&quot; When Passing People</strong></font></a><br>
As we continue blindly on our selfish spirals inward, we fail to take notice of small
things, like passersby. The streets are mean enough, what with stabbings and shootings.
Why add rudeness to the malevolent list? Be nice; smile and say, &quot;Hey, how you doing,
friend? Say, that's a nice hat you've got there. Really makes your face look oval,&quot;
or something equally as pleasant. Other street travelers will appreciate such a simple yet
powerful gesture, and perhaps greet you in the same way a short time later, as you wile
away your time sipping an egg-cream in front of the Woolworth's. </p>

<hr>
<a name="phone"><font SIZE="+1"><strong>

<p align="center">10. Don't Use a Phone Call When a Letter is Appropriate</strong></font></a><br>
Yes, yes. It's a modern world. Things move quickly. It's bang! bang! bang! or you miss
that <em>Get Smart</em> rerun on Nick-at-Nite. But sometimes you just have to slow down.
Consider, for once in your I-am-a-tachyon life, the myriad contexts existing in what you
might consider a somewhat uniform reality. Now imagine all the invisible social rules for
each and all of those contexts. You know the rules -- either instinctively or by childhood
-- and, as a member of society, have implicitly agreed to abide by them. So take the time;
put the receiver down. Pick up that pen or keyboard and make it your personal goal to
reinvigorate the lost art of correspondence. Don't even think about electronic mail; it
carries the same personal significance, when compared to postal mail, as phone sex does
compared to hiring a real hooker. </p>

<hr>
<a name="dirt"><font SIZE="+1"><strong>

<p align="center">11. At Least Once a Week, Roll Around in Dirt</strong></font></a><br>
Some call this grounding. Rev. Ralphfile://localhost/c:/superc~1/church/ba.htm calls it <strong>Soilic
Cycling</strong>. The action is simple: go outside to an unpaved area, drop to the ground,
and start frolicking in the mineral-rich earth. This has two main effects. First, it will
remind you that you are, indeed, a part of the earth, connected as a baby to its mother
through the umbilical. This is something easily forgotten by a race that creates its own
world in much more than a rational sense. We need to feel that we are part of something
great, something real and material, aside from any spiritual sense of belonging. Our
closest bond as humans and living creatures is our absolute physical mortality. Tumbling
in the grass with the remains of countless other mortal entities helps us keep this in
mind. And second, it's just plain fun. </p>

<hr>
<a name="judge"><font SIZE="+1"><strong>

<p align="center">12. Always Judge With Compassion</strong></font></a><br>
We make decisions constantly and continuously. Often these decisions are unconscious, or
so influenced by various genetic and cultural factors that they are de facto dispositions.
There are many decisions, though, that allow enough time for consideration, and these we
deem judgments. It is these judgments that occupy much of our time. And as we all know,
time spent in a negative manner is time poorly spent. So give people the benefit of the
doubt, or even more if you are able. When Cindy says, &quot;Jim, what do you think of my
new haircut?&quot; You could answer honestly, saying, &quot;It makes your head look like a
turnip,&quot; or you could be compassionate and say, &quot;Gosh, Cindy. I guess I'd have
to say I think it looks just as it was intended to look. And that's a good thing.&quot;
Then, you can follow this compassionate and complimentary judgment by telling her how knit
caps are all the rage in Paris. </p>

<hr>
<a name="eat"><font SIZE="+1"><strong>

<p align="center">13. Never Eat Anything Bigger Than Your Head</strong></font></a><br>
This is such good advice, and the reasons behind it so plentiful and obvious, that we will
just let it stand with no further explanation, save this: it doesn't apply to popcorn or
anything at least 80% sorghum. </p>

<hr>
<a name="route"><font SIZE="+1"><strong>

<p align="center">14. When You Have Two Ways to Go, Choose the Prettier Route</strong></font></a><br>
Highways offer endless, numbing views of billboard advertisements, which surreptitiously
fool you into thinking the world of marketers' projections is actually the world around
you. Stay away from them whenever possible. The world is full of backways and crossways,
with wonderful views of foals, fauna, and fungi. Grandma can kill a few more hours
knitting her worries and brows while you're breathing some slightly less toxic air and
waving at friendly trees. What's the big rush anyway? </p>

<hr>
<a name="fear"><font SIZE="+1"><strong>

<p align="center">15. Don't Live in Fear of the &quot;Other&quot;</strong></font></a><br>
The easiest way to justify an unjustifiable position is by bringing in an imaginary foe.
This immanent bogeyman can be seen lurking around partisan political debates, gun shows,
and every dark alley and relationship. The other exists only in minds plagued by fear. Bad
things will happen, that much is certain. To guard against them is natural, but to let
minor precautions turn into obsessive paranoia is to slide into the loneliness and false
security of individualism. Don't protect your thoughts and person to the point of
quarantine. Open yourself and let the potential horrors be buffered by all the actual
beauty. </p>
